# Prosper-Loan-Tableau-Analysis-Project

For this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set.
My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encoding,
design principles, and effective communication.
